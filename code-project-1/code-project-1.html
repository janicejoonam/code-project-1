        <img style="float: left; margin-right: 40px;" src="img/janice.png" />I was born in Seoul, South Korea but Portland, Oregon will always be my home. I graduated from Oregon State University with a Bachelor of Science in Human Development and Family Sciences in 2015. I worked for Impartial Medical Opinions (IMO) for a little over a year, where I started as a collator and moved my way up to supporting a team of <strong>34</strong> doctors. Organizing their patient charts, and scheduling appointments or legal follow-up events, such as phone conferences, addendums, and trials. IMO shortly after got bought out by a corporation, ExamWorks (EW). My manager promoted me to the Project Manager role to help merge two companies together and help run operations. I worked closely with the IT team to propose changes to the database system (IMECentric) so that the staff could complete tasks more efficiently and get printers, computers, phones, desks, and accounts set up. It was gratifying each time we came up with a solution, which sparked my interest in learning how the IT team generated the proposed ideas in the new system updates.
